    <P>
        Cultivate your hunger
Before you idealize <br>
Motivate your anger <br>
To make them all realize <br>
Climbing the mountain <br>
never coming down <br>
Break into the contents <br>
Never falling down <br>
My knee is still shaking <br>
Like I was 12 <br>
Sneaking out the classroom <br>
By the back door <br>
A man rallied at me twice though <br> 
But I didn't care <br>
Waiting is waisting for people like me<br>
Don't try <br>
To live so wise <br>
Don't cry <br>
'Cause your so right <br>
Don't dry <br>
With fakes or fears <br>
'Cause you will hate yourself in the end <br>
Don't try <br>
To live so wise <br>
Don't cry <br>
'Cause your so right <br>
Don't dry <br>
With fakes or fears <br>
'Cause you will hate yourself in the end <br>
You say <br>
Dreams are dreams <br>
I ain't <br>
Gonna play the fool <br>
Anymore <br>
You say <br>
'Cause I still got my soul <br>
Take your time baby <br>
Your blood need slowin' down <br>
Breach your soul to reach yourselfâ€¦ <br>
    </P>
